# Setup

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Based on platform you might have to follow the [PyTorch setup process](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to enable CUDA support.

Run scripts as modules:

```python
python -m optimization.optimization
```

# Optimization

`notebooks/optimization.ipynb` runs the optimization loop defined in `optimization/optimization.py` and preserves access to the model.
